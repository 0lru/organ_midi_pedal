# Organ Midi Pedal
Organ Midi Pedal built from scratch.

For reading sensors, I've installed an Arduino Nano. A driver program written in Python forwards the data to Grand Orgue
with the help of LoopMidi. It is intentional that there're only 20 keys. Adaption
to 30-32 keys for other projects may be possible with a reasonable effort.
